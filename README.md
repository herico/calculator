## Welcome to calculator from basic to advance with Vanilla Javascript

I am going to build a calculator from basic to advance with scientific funcionalities all using only Vanilla Javascript, most of the code will be written in ES2015 but that's okay nowadays because lot of browsers support ECMAScript 2015.

You can visit the project in the github pages [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://herico.github.io/calculator/).
